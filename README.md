## 🚀 What the Project is About

This site is a modernized renovation attempt of the original MQ Software Technology learning portal. It aims to provide first-year and introductory computer science students (enrolled in COMP1000, COMP1010, COMP2160, COMP6010, and related units at Macquarie University) with a clean, highly readable, responsive, and visual study resource. 

The site is built with:
*   **Highly structured learning modules** containing assumed knowledge and clear learning outcomes.
*   **Embedded instructional videos** (primarily YouTube tutorials).
*   **Interactive exercise blocks** with expandable code solutions.
*   **Typeset mathematical equations** for computer science theory.
*   **Rich diagrams and visualizations** (such as SVG and D3.js scripts) to help students grasp programming concepts visually.

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Architecture

This is a static website built on **Jekyll** (Ruby's static site generator) and themed with **Just the Docs**.

*   **Static Site Generator:** Jekyll
*   **Theme:** `just-the-docs/just-the-docs` (managed as a remote theme for ease of updates).
*   **Math Rendering:** **KaTeX** (loaded dynamically for performance, only on pages that request it).
*   **Diagram Rendering:** **Mermaid.js** (configured to render flowcharts, sequence diagrams, and structures directly from markdown text).
*   **Visualizations:** **D3.js v7** (custom code is hooked in to create responsive and interactive vector graphics).
*   **Styling Engine:** Custom **SASS/SCSS** overrides located in `_sass/custom/custom.scss` to handle layout adjustments, mobile responsiveness, exercise panels, and code block formatting.

## 💡 New to Jekyll & Just the Docs? (A Quick Crash Course)

If you come from a JavaScript/Node.js or Python background, Ruby-based tools like Jekyll might feel a bit different at first. Here is a quick conceptual map to help you get started:

*   **Jekyll is a Static Site Generator:** You write content in Markdown (`.md`) files (inside `docs/`), and Jekyll compiles them into standard, fast-loading HTML pages.
*   **Gemfile & Gemfile.lock:** These are the Ruby equivalents of `package.json` and `package-lock.json`. They define all the project's dependencies (plugins, themes, etc.).
*   **Bundler (`bundle`):** This is the Ruby package manager, similar to `npm`. Running `bundle install` is just like running `npm install`, and `bundle exec jekyll serve` is like running `npm run dev`.
*   **Just the Docs (JTD):** This is our theme. It reads metadata at the top of your Markdown files (called YAML Front Matter) and automatically generates the page templates, the sidebar navigation, and the search indexing. You don't need to manually link pages to the sidebar!
*   **⚠️ The Compiled Site (`_site/`):** When you run the local server, Jekyll outputs the generated site to the `_site/` directory. **Never edit files inside `_site/` directly!** Any changes there will be overwritten the next time Jekyll compiles. Always edit files in `docs/`, `_includes/`, or `_sass/`.

## 🧪 Demonstration & Test Pages

The project includes two hidden utility pages that are excluded from the main sidebar navigation (`nav_exclude: true`). They are incredibly useful for course developers to reference and test layout features:

*   **Demonstration Page (`/demo`):** Located at [docs/demo.md](file:///wsl.localhost/Ubuntu-24.04/home/crystal/softwareTechDemo/docs/demo.md). It showcases rendered examples of all standard components—headings, styled callouts, exercise blocks, YouTube videos, KaTeX equations, and D3.js visual scripts—so developers can see how elements look when published.
*   **Test Page (`/test`):** Located at [docs/test.md](file:///wsl.localhost/Ubuntu-24.04/home/crystal/softwareTechDemo/docs/test.md). It serves as a staging/sandbox area for developers to test grid structures, embed scripts, layout rendering, and Mermaid.js diagrams before pushing changes live.

## ✍️ Content Authoring & Contribution Guidelines

Writing new content or editing existing pages is straightforward. All files in the `docs/` folder are written in **Markdown** with custom Jekyll helpers.

### 1. Folder-to-URL Path Matching

To keep the project clean and maintainable, the physical folder path of every Markdown file must exactly mirror its website URL path (permalink).

*   **Rule:** If a page is meant to live at the URL `/comp1000/loops`, the source file **must** be created at `docs/comp1000/loops.md`.
*   **Assets:** Any assets (images, codes, scripts) for that page must similarly live inside a matching subfolder under assets: `assets/comp1000/loops/{images/ ,code/ ,js/}`.
*   **Why this matters:** This 1-to-1 mapping ensures that the browser URL navigation doubles as a file explorer map for developers. It also makes it possible to remove manual `permalink` Front Matter tags in the future, as Jekyll can auto-generate routes directly from directory locations.

### 2. Front Matter Settings
Every page must start with a YAML block at the very top. For example:
```yaml
---
title: Primitive Operations                    # Title shown in the sidebar navigation
custom-title: Primitive Operations of Processing # (Optional) Title shown at the top of the page, defauls to title
permalink: /comp1000/primitive-operations     # The URL path of the page
parent: COMP1000                              # Links this page to a parent navigation category
nav_order: 2                                  # The order in which it appears in the sidebar
use_katex: true                               # Set to true if the page uses math formulas ($ or $$)
author: "Gaurav Gupta"                       # (Optional) Named page author(s), defaults to Gaurav Gupta
---
```

### 3. Auto-Generating Table of Contents
To generate an in-page table of contents automatically, place the following code right below your Front Matter:
```markdown
- TOC
{:toc}
```

### 4. Adding Course Pre-requisites & Learning Outcomes
To keep courses structured, use the `prereq_outcomes.html` helper:
```markdown
{% capture topic_prereq %}
* [Transition to Processing]({{ site.baseurl }}/comp1000/transition-to-processing)
{% endcapture %}

{% capture topic_outcomes %}
* Understand static sketches.
* Understand categories of values and types.
{% endcapture %}

{% include prereq_outcomes.html prereq=topic_prereq outcomes=topic_outcomes %}
```

### 5. Creating Standard Exercises
Exercises should be formatted using the `exercise.html` include. This keeps the look consistent and nests the solution inside an expandable button:
```markdown
{% capture my_problem %}
Identify the output of the following statement:
```java
println(17 / 5);
```
{% endcapture %}

{% capture my_solution %}
The output is `3` due to integer division (the decimal part is discarded).
{% endcapture %}

{% include exercise.html
  title="Exercise: Integer Division"
  problem=my_problem
  solution=my_solution
%}
```

### 6. Applying Stylized Callouts
You can format blockquotes and warning callouts using the predefined Jekyll CSS helper classes:
```markdown
{: .note}
> **Note:** Here is some helpful background information.

{: .warning}
> **Warning!** Watch out for integer division!

{: .readings}
> **Reading(s):** Daniel Shiffman, Chapter 1 & 2.
```
*(Predefined classes include: `.note`, `.warning`, `.highlight`, `.keynote`, `.readings`).*

### 7. Math Equations (KaTeX)
To enable math rendering:
1.  Ensure `use_katex: true` is in the page's YAML Front Matter.
2.  Use standard LaTeX syntax:
    *   Inline math: Wrap in single dollar signs (e.g., `$E = mc^2$`).
    *   Block/Display math: Wrap in double dollar signs (e.g., `$$a^2 + b^2 = c^2$$`).

## 🛠️ Maintenance & Roadmap (Future Tasks)

If you are a developer looking to contribute to the codebase or improve the platform, here are our current priorities:

### Top Priorities
*   **Reorganise the `assets` folder (Hybrid Course-Topic-Type model):** 
    *   Separate global site-wide assets (theme CSS, general JS libraries, logos) into `assets/{css,js,images}`.
    *   Reorganise course content assets into a **Course -> Topic -> Asset-Type** hierarchy (e.g., `assets/comp1000/loops/images/`, `assets/comp1000/loops/code/`). Clean up the flat structures inside the current `comp1000` and `comp1010` folders, and update all corresponding image/code source links in the markdown files.
*   **KaTeX mobile responsiveness:** 
    *   Ensure complex block equations adjust correctly to smaller screens without breaking layout wrappers.
*   **Perform site-wide quality checks:**
    *   Verify page functionality to ensure all content is loading and working as intended.
    *   Check for broken paths, missing image attachments, or broken external links.
    *   Test mobile responsiveness and functionality to verify layout files, images, and embedded widgets adjust correctly on narrow screens.
    *   Audit style consistency to make sure page titles, headings, and custom templates match guidelines.

### Nice-to-Have Improvements
*   **Convert Legacy Tasks:** 
    *   Find any legacy `<div class="task">` blocks and convert them to the modern `{% include exercise.html ... %}` layout format.
*   **Remove `docs/` from URLs:** 
    *   Configure Jekyll settings to avoid needing manual permalinks for directory structures.
*   **Replace static diagrams:** 
    *   Convert static images into dynamic, maintainable **Mermaid.js** diagrams, SVGs, or interactive **D3.js** charts.
*   **Implement Automated Testing & Validation Suites:**
    *   **Link & Asset Checking:** Set up automated link checking (e.g., via `html-proofer` or custom workflows) to continuously audit internal paths, external links, and verify that local image files and embedded YouTube video players load successfully.
    *   **Mobile Layout Overflow Audits:** Write automated checks (e.g., using headless browsers like Playwright) to scan page renderings and verify that code blocks, tables, and custom exercise widgets fit correctly on mobile viewports without causing horizontal scroll overflows.
*   **Establish Consistent Linting & Project Formatting:**
    *   **Markdown & Stylesheet Linter:** Set up linters/formatters (e.g., `Prettier` or `markdownlint`) to enforce consistent spacing, formatting, and file structures across all Markdown and SCSS source files.
    *   **Student Code Snippet Validator:** Create a utility script to extract, validate, and lint the Java/Processing code blocks featured in the documentation. The script should verify that all standard examples are syntactically correct, while ignoring or expecting failures for intentionally "bad" code examples (e.g., by checking for a special tag like `{: .bad-code}`).

### Potential & Known Issues
*   **Exercise Block TOC Exclusion:** 
    *   Because exercise blocks (`{% include exercise.html ... %}`) are rendered dynamically via Jekyll includes after the markdown parser builds the in-page Table of Contents (TOC), their titles (e.g., `### Exercise Title`) are not included in the auto-generated TOC block.

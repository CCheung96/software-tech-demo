# Discussion

A function is a *named* piece of code with zero or more inputs that optionally returns a value back to the caller.

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/comp1000/functions/functionMemoryDiagrams-figure0.png" style="width: 300px; margin: 16px"/>

<!--For example, we may have a function that determines the higher of two integers. We can call it by passing it two integers. If we pass the values 2 and 5, it should return 5.

<center><img src="functionsFigs/functionMemoryDiagrams-figure1.png" style="width: 300px;"/></center>

However, if we pass only one value, it cannot be executed, as it expects two integers.

<center><img src="functionsFigs/functionMemoryDiagrams-figure2.png" style="width: 300px;"/></center>

Similarly, you cannot pass it more than 2 values.

<center><img src="functionsFigs/functionMemoryDiagrams-figure3.png" style="width: 300px;"/></center>

Even if you pass two values, you must ensure they are of the right type. For example, we cannot pass a `boolean` instead of an integer.

## Designing a function

While designing a function, you must think of three aspects carefully:

1. Input(s)
2. Purpose (decides the name of the function)
3. Return value (Type of answer)

### Example 1

```
Alice -> Bob: Is 5 an even number?
Bob --> Alice: No.
Charles -> Bob: Is -18 an even number?
Bob --> Charles: Yes.
```

Here, *"Bob"* is the function that expects an integer value to be supplied to them, and gives the answer *"Yes"/"No"* back to the client (caller).

1. Input: `int`
2. Purpose: `isEven`
3. Return value: boolean

### Example 2

```
Alice -> Bob: What is 12.8 rounded-off to the nearest integer?
Bob --> Alice: 13.
Charles -> Bob: What is -3.01 rounded-off to the nearest integer?
Bob --> Charles: -3.
Diane -> Bob: What is "Super Nintendo Chalmers" rounded-off to the nearest integer?
Bob --> Diane: GO AWAY!
Elise -> Bob: What are 1.5 and -2.7 rounded-off to the nearest integer?
Bob --> Elise: One number at a time, please.
```

Here, we have intentionally made invalid calls from Diane (and Elise) to Bob. This shows that Bob expects one (and only one) `float` to be provided.

1. Input: `float`
2. Purpose: `roundedOff`
3. Return value: `int`

## Defining a function

All functions have _just one_ function definition - the place that the function itself is described.  Syntax of a function _definition_ is:

```java
returnType function(<parameters>) {
    <some code>
    <if>
    	<return statement>
    <endif>
    <some code>
    <return statement>
}
```

Once this exists, you can have _many_ function calls - the place that the code asks the function to run.  Syntax of a function _call_ is:

```processing
functionName (<parameters>);
```

For example, the following function _definition_

```processing
int foo(int a, int b){
    int result = a + b;
    return result;
}
```

can be called by anywhere in the program. For example,

```processing
void setup() {
	int y = foo(12, 5);
}
```

During the call `foo(12, 5)`, 

- Function `foo` expects two integers
- The values passed are 12 and 5 (2 integers). So it's all good
- 12 is copied into the local variable `a` 
- 5 is copied into the local variable `b`
- Control is transferred to the function
- `result` becomes 17.
- This value 17 is returned by the function and replaces the call `foo(12, 5)`.
- Control transfers back to the calling statement.
- The statement becomes `int y = 17;` since the call is replaced by the value it returns.

## Formal and Actual parameters

Since we have both function definitions and function calls, and parameters appear in each, it is useful to be able to distinguish the two uses.
  * Parameters appearing in the top line (signature) of a function definition are called _formal parameters_ and are defined in the same way as any other variable declaration. In the example above, `a` and `b` are the *formal parameters*.
  * Parameters appearing in a function call are called _actual paramters_ and work like any other value in Processing. In the example above, 12 and 5 are the *actual parameters*.

When the function is executed, the actual paramters are copied into the formal paramter slots and the function is run.

<div class="task" markdown="1">
Suppose we have a function that accepts a real number (`float`) and returns its square.

Draw a block diagram for the interaction when a caller calls the function with the value 2.5. Assume the name of the formal parameter is `val`, and the value returned by the function is copied into a variable `sqr`.

<div class="task" markdown="1">
Consider the following function definition,

```java
int roundOff(float a) {
	return (int)(a+0.5);
}
```

Write a statement that calls the function `roundOff` with the parameter 6.8 and stores the value returned in a variable `result`.
<details markdown="1"><summary>Solution</summary>

```java
int result;
result = roundOff(6.8);
```
</details>
</div>

<div class="task" markdown="1">
Which of the following are valid calls to function `roundOff`?

1. `int a = roundOff(4.5);`
2. `int b = roundOff(8);`
3. `roundOff(2.6);`
4. `float c = roundOff(-1.53);`
5. `int d = roundOff(3.2, 4.8);`
6. `int e = roundOff();`
7. `int e = roundOff(true);`

<details markdown="1"><summary>Solution</summary>

1. Yes
2. Yes, the integer is treated like a float when it arrives in the formal parameter.  It is identical to writing `float a = 8`
3. Yes, the return value is thrown away, but that is allowed
4. Yes, the return value is treated like a float when it arrives in `c`
5. No, too many actual parameters
6. No, not enough acutal parameters
7. No, actual parameter type does not match formal parameter type.

<div class="task" markdown="1">

Define a function that when passed two integers, returns their average. Remember that 15/2 is 7 while 15/2.0 is 7.5.

<details markdown="1"><summary>Solution</summary>

```java
float average(int a, int b){
    return (a + b)/2.0;
}
```
</details>
</div>

## void functions

Functions that perform some action (like drawing something or displaying some text) but don't return a value have a return type of void. They can still have a `return;` statement, that transfers control back to the caller.

For example,

```processing
void drawShip() {
	//IMPORTANT: should draw the ship ONLY if mouse is in the right half
	
	if(mouseX < width/2) { //no need to draw
		return; //transfer control back to the caller
	}
	
	line(mouseX+50, mouseY-20, mouseX+50, mouseY+10);
	triangle(mouseX, mouseY, mouseX+100, mouseY, mouseX+50, mouseY+20);
	
	//control automatically transferred once you reach the end
	///so no need to have return statement
}
```

and the call,

```processing
void draw() {
	background(255);
	drawShip();
}
```

## Effectively unconditional return

A function that promises to return a value, must do so *effectively* unconditionally.

Take the following example,

```processing
boolean isEven(int n) {
	if(n%2 == 0) {
		return true;
	}
	if(n%2 != 0) {
		return false;
	}
}
```

While mathematically, one of the two boolean expressions (`n%2 == 0` and `n%2 != 0`) WILL be `true`, the programming language doesn't make that optimization. For JavaProcessing, the two return statements are in conditional blocks. Hence, you will get a compilation error - `method must return a value of type boolean`.

To fix this, you should use,

```processing
boolean isEven(int n) {
	if(n%2 == 0) {
		return true;
	}
	else {
		return false;
	}
}
``` 

Now, in terms of programming, either the `if` block, or the `else` block are guaranteed to execute, thereby returning a value unconditionally.

## Statements or Expressions?

  * function declarations are statements.
  * function calls are statements if the function returns `void`.
  * function calls are statements _and_ expressions if they return a value.
  * formal parameters are statements.
  * actual parameters are expressions.

The fact that a function call in processing can _do_ something and also _evaluate to a value_ makes them special.  In fact, this double-life is a bit of a point of friction in language design.  Some languages insist that functions must be statements and others insist they must be expressions, but those are rare.  The situation we have here, while strange, is quite common.

#### Number of digits in an integer

<div class="task" markdown="1">

Define a function that when passed an integer, returns the number of digits in the integer.

<details markdown="1"><summary>Solution</summary>

```java
int digits(int input){
    int totalSoFar = 0;
    while (input > 0) {
        totalSoFar++;
        intput = input / 10;
    }
    return totalSoFar;
}
```

#### Is Divisible

<div class="task" markdown="1">

Given two integers (store in formal parameters `a, b`), define a function that determines if either of them is divisible by the other. Some input-output mappings are:

  * `a = 14, b = 6` --> return `false`
  * `a = 14, b = 7` --> return `true`
  * `a = 9, b = 30` --> return `false`
  * `a = 9, b = 36` --> return `true`
  * `a = 12, b = 0` --> return `true` (0 is divisible by 12)

<details markdown="1"><summary>Solution</summary>

```java
/*
	We need to check if divisible both ways. That is, a % b and b % a. 
	Notice, that taking modulus 0 of a number will crash our program with a "ArithmeticException: / by zero" error.
	We need to only apply the modulus after ensuring the number is not 0 to circumvent that.
*/
boolean isDivisible(int a, int b){
    if(b!=0 && a%b==0) {
    	return true;
    }
    if(a!=0 && b%a==0) {
    	return true;
    }
    return false;
}
```

#### Leap Years

<div class="task" markdown="1">

A year is leap if it satisfies one of the two conditions,

1. it's divisible by 400, or,
2. it's divisible by 4 but **NOT** by 100.

Define a function that determines if an year passed (store in formal parameter `year`) is `leap`. Return `true` if it's a leap year, and `false` otherwise. Some input-output mappings are:

  * `year = 2016` --> return `true`
  * `year = 1800` --> return `false`
  * `year = 2018` --> return `false`
  * `year = 1600` --> return `true`

<details markdown="1"><summary>Solution</summary>

```java
boolean isLeapYear(int year){
    return (isDivisible(year, 400) || (isDivisible(year, 4) && !isDivisible(year 100)));
}
```

#### Non-trivial divisors

<div class="task" markdown="1">


I would like to count the number of non-trivial (apart from 1 and itself) divisors of a given integer. Some input-output mappings are:

  * `n = 18` --> return `4` (as there are 4 non-trivial divisors: 2, 3, 6, 9)
  * `n = 31` --> return `0` (as there is no non-trivial divisor of 31)
  * `n = 77` --> return `2` (as there are 2 non-trivial divisors: 7, 11)

<details markdown="1"><summary>Solution</summary>

```java
int divisors(int input){
    found = 0;
    for(int i = 2; i < input; i++){
        if (isDivisible(input, i){
            found++;
        }
    }
    return found;
}
```
